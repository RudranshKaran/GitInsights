# UI Design & Design System

## Objective

The objective of this document is to define a consistent visual language for GitInsight that supports clarity, readability, and professionalism. The design system ensures that the interface remains coherent, scalable, and easy to maintain as the product evolves.

The focus is on **functionality-first design**, not decorative visuals.
