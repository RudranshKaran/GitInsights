# Wireframing & UX Design

## Objective

The objective of this phase is to define the structure and layout of each key screen in GitInsight before applying any visual design. The focus is on **information hierarchy**, **clarity**, and **ease of use**.

Wireframes are kept intentionally low-fidelity to prioritize usability over aesthetics.

## Key Screens Overview

1. Landing Page
2. Repository Input Page
3. Analysis Loading Screen
