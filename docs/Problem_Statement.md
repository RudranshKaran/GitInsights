# Problem Statement

## Overview

Students and early-stage developers actively build personal and academic projects and publish them on GitHub as proof of their skills. However, a large number of these repositories fail to create a strong impression on recruiters and internship evaluators.

The issue is not a lack of technical ability or effort, but poor project presentation. Common problems include weak or missing documentation, unclear project structure, inconsistent coding practices, and no clear indication of whether a project meets internship or industry expectations. As a result, many capable candidates are overlooked because their projects fail to communicate their true value.

## Target Users

- Undergraduate and graduate students  
- Early-stage developers applying for internships or entry-level roles  
- Self-taught developers building portfolio projects  
- Hackathon participants and open-source beginners

## Existing Solutions and Gaps

Several tools and platforms provide basic repository analytics such as stars, forks, commit counts, and programming language usage. Some solutions also offer static code analysis and linting.

However, these tools do not:
- Evaluate projects from a recruiter or internship-readiness perspective  
- Provide clear and actionable improvement guidance  
- Assess documentation quality and overall project clarity  
- Help translate projects into resume-ready descriptions  

There is currently no simple tool that answers the question:

> *Is this GitHub project internship-ready, and what exactly needs improvement?*

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build an AI-powered GitHub Project Reviewer that evaluates a public GitHub repository using structured, internship-oriented criteria and provides actionable feedback.

The system aims to bridge the gap between **building a project** and **presenting it professionally**, helping students showcase their work more effectively.

## Success Metrics (KPIs)

- Generation of a structured evaluation report for any public GitHub repository  
- Clear scoring across predefined project quality dimensions  
- Actionable recommendations to improve documentation, structure, and code clarity  
- Automatic generation of concise, resume-ready project bullet points  
- Positive feedback from users regarding clarity and usefulness

## Why This Problem Matters

Recruiters often spend only a few seconds reviewing a GitHub repository. Without clear structure and strong documentation, even technically sound projects may fail to stand out.

Solving this problem directly improves student visibility, confidence, and real-world employability by ensuring their work is evaluated and presented in a professional manner.
