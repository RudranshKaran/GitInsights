# Market & User Research

## Objective

The objective of this research is to understand the current landscape of GitHub-related tools, identify gaps in how student projects are evaluated and presented, and define a clear opportunity for differentiation. This research focuses on both **market offerings** and **user expectations**, particularly from the perspective of students and recruiters.

---

## Target Market

### Primary Users
- Students applying for internships or entry-level roles
- Early-stage developers building portfolio projects
- Hackathon participants and self-taught developers

### Secondary Stakeholders
- Recruiters and internship evaluators
- Technical interviewers reviewing GitHub profiles
- Mentors and educators guiding student projects

---

## User Pain Points

Based on common student experiences and recruiter feedback, the following pain points were identified:

### Student Pain Points
- Uncertainty about whether a project is “good enough” for internships
- Lack of clarity on what recruiters actually look for in GitHub repositories
- Difficulty writing meaningful README files and documentation
- Inability to convert project work into strong resume bullet points
- No structured feedback loop for personal projects

### Recruiter Pain Points
- Limited time to evaluate repositories in depth
- Inconsistent project quality and documentation standards
- Difficulty quickly understanding project scope and impact
- Over-reliance on surface-level signals (stars, forks, activity)

---

## Competitive Analysis

### Existing Solutions

| Tool / Platform Type | What They Do Well | Limitations |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| GitHub Insights & Stats | Repository activity metrics | No quality or readiness evaluation |
| Code linters & analyzers | Code-level quality checks | Ignore documentation and presentation |
| Portfolio websites | Showcase projects visually | No automated evaluation or feedback |
| Resume review tools | Improve resume formatting | Do not analyze actual GitHub projects |

---

## Identified Gaps in the Market

Current solutions fail to address the following critical areas:

- No **holistic evaluation** of a GitHub project
- No scoring based on **internship or recruiter expectations**
- Lack of **actionable, prioritized improvement suggestions**
- No direct support for **resume-ready project descriptions**
- Absence of a student-focused, mentorship-style reviewer

There is a clear gap between **technical analysis tools** and **career-oriented project evaluation**.

---

## Opportunity for Differentiation

The proposed solution differentiates itself by:

- Evaluating projects the way a **recruiter or senior engineer** would
- Focusing equally on **code quality, structure, and documentation**
- Providing **clear next steps** instead of abstract feedback
- Translating technical work into **career-relevant outcomes**
- Acting as a **virtual project mentor**, not just an analyzer

---

## Unique Value Proposition

> A single tool that tells students how good their GitHub project really is, what exactly to improve, and how to present it professionally for internships and resumes.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Students lack structured feedback on personal projects
- Recruiters need faster clarity, not more metrics
- Existing tools focus on fragments, not the full picture
- There is strong demand for a project reviewer that bridges **engineering quality** and **career readiness**

---

## Conclusion

Market and user research confirms a clear unmet need for a GitHub project evaluation tool that prioritizes clarity, readiness, and professional presentation. By targeting this gap, the proposed system aligns technical improvement with real-world hiring expectations.
